I was between using a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Model and decided on the latter because we have a fairly large data set, and at this point in the project I am not trying to extract why a decision was made, but trying to see if a model can predict veracity at all in the first place. As such, I thought using a Random Forest Classifier would give us a good indication at how well models in general would do, so that if it turns out that this initial model does not work well, we can investigate if we need to change some of our earlier data preparation work."

    "We can see based on the metrics we used to judge our model that it was better than chance at predicting whether a statement was true or false. However, There were nearly 1000 (almost a quarter of the training set) false positives, indicating a pretty wide error margin. The ROC curve is a visual representation of this matrix, suggesting that the model is better than chance but still has many false negatives and false positives. The precision score is only .69, which shows that our True Positive rate is not very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future steps, we should tune this model to see if other hyperparameters may be able to improve these scores. We should also look at other predictors, such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to see if these methods perform better than this Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, however, the fact that our model has any predicitive power is encouraging. It suggests that there is something within the statements that can be used to detect if a statement is true or false. And while it is far to early to say what these things are, or what that even truly means, it does reveal that there is something to be learned through further analysis."
